Basis of Estimate

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The Lower Missouri River Basin Flood Risk and Resiliency Comprehensive Study, also referred to as the System Plan, is a framework of flood risk management measures that can be made to reduce the frequency or the consequences of flooding on the lower 735 miles of the Missouri River. The System Plan evaluated 8 alternatives to provide recommendations on future USACE studies and projects that could be constructed by others. The System Plan itself has no construction recommendations. The Alternatives that were evaluated are listed below.

#### Alternative 1 Increased Conveyance.

This alternative model includes setting back levees, removing levees, and modifying bridges opening to widen the floodway and open up of pinch points that constrict the levee to move more water through the system and reduce damages caused by flooding.

#### Alternative 2 Transportation and Critical Infrastructure

This alternative identifies roadways that are inundated by the 0.01 AEP flow. This information will be used to identify which transportation routes could benefit from elevation for other entities to implement in their future roadway plans. The alternative also includes building new ring levees around critical infrastructure facilities such as water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plant, and power plants that are currently inundated by the 0.01 AEP flow.

#### Alternative 3 Increased Level of Performance

This alternative identifies and raises all federal, non-federal, and private levees in-place to contain the approximate 0.01 AEP flow.

Alternative 4 Increased Conveyance with Increased Level of Performance.

This alternative is a combination of Alternatives 1 and 3. This alternative model includes the same levee setbacks in Alternative 1 but with levees raised to an elevation to pass the 0.01 AEP flow. Levees that were not setback in Alternative 1 were also modeled as raised to pass the 0.01 AEP flow where needed.

#### Alternative 5 Resiliency

This alternative identifies levees that would benefit from resiliency measures. Resiliency measures focus on improving performance of all federal and active non-federal levees in the study area. The measures included in this alternative levee underseepage control, interior drainage improvements, planned overtopping, levee erosion protection, and extending or raising tie backs. Levee underseepage improvements focused mainly on underseepage berms on the federal levees as most of the nonfederal have more frequent overtopping frequencies. Resiliency measures were not individually modeled but the hydraulic model was used to help identify ideal locations.

#### Alternative 6 Nonstructural Measures

This alternative identifies area for wet and dry flood proofing, structure raises and elevation or new mainstem gages.

#### Alternative 7 New Levees or Levee Features

This alternative identifies areas where flood damages could be reduced with construction of a flood risk management feature either where there is not one currently or to replace a privately constructed feature.

#### Alternative 8 System Plan

This alternative is a combination of selected measures from all the other alternatives.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**2.0 BASIS OF ESTIMATE**

These cost estimates are based on the Basis of Estimate provided by the PM titled "LoMo System Plan – Basis of Estimate" which includes a description of the work. Further clarification was obtained from the Project Delivery Team (PDT). See Attachment 1 – LoMo System Plan – Basis of Estimate.pdf for the Basis of Estimate. Following Engineering Regulation (ER) 1110-2-1302, *Engineering and Design Civil Works Cost Estimating*, the cost estimate was prepared at one level:

• **Class 5** for the refinement of the final viable array of alternatives, which was based on a concept design. Cost was developed from rough quantity take-offs and supplemented with best professional judgment based on similar projects.

Cost engineering did not develop costs for nonstructural alternatives (Alternative 6) or for the System Plan (Alternative 8). The PM developed costs for Alternative 8 by combing the costs developed in Alternatives 1-5 and 7 for the measures that were pulled forward into Alternative 8. Alternative 8 costs do not include nonstructural costs from Alternative 6.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**3.0 ESTIMATED DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE**

The estimate is based on the current date escalated to the midpoint of construction which is assumed to be 2034Q1. No construction recommendations are coming from this report.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**4.0 COST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS**

## <span id="page-7-1"></span>**4.1 Effective Price Level.**

Project costs are presented in October 2033 (1Q2034) dollars.

# <span id="page-7-2"></span>**4.2 Construction Cost Estimate.**

The construction cost estimate was developed using MCACES 2nd Generation estimating software in accordance with ER 1110-2-1302, Civil Works Cost Engineering, 30 June 2016; UFC 3-740-05, Handbook: Construction Cost Estimating, 9 December 2022. The construction cost estimate was prepared using MII Version 4.4.4, and the latest 2024 English Cost Book, quotes on major material items, and 2024 Equipment Library (Region 5).

# <span id="page-7-3"></span>**4.3 Levee Cost Estimating Tool 2-25-2025**.

The Levee Cost Estimating tool was used for a majority of the cost estimate. All items not using the Levee Cost Estimating tool are using the following:

<span id="page-7-4"></span>**Labor Rates.** - The labor rates used are Davis Bacon wage rates for the Jackson County, Missouri General Decision Number MO20250001 Mod#3 for Heavy construction.

<span id="page-7-5"></span>**Labor and Equipment Productivity -** No overtime hours have been included in the MCACES estimate. The estimate includes an overall Productivity factor of 100 percent which is based on anticipated project difficulty, method of construction, labor availability, supervision, job conditions, weather and expected delays.

<span id="page-7-6"></span>**Equipment Rates -** Equipment rates were derived from EP1110-1-8 Equipment Ownership and Expenses Schedule for Region 5 published 2024. The price level date for this manual is assumed to be Jan 2024. A 5% adjustment factor was included in the MCACES estimate to normalize the costs to 2nd Quarter 2025**.** 

<span id="page-7-7"></span>**Material Rates -** Minor Material costs were derived from CB24EN – MII English Cost Book 2024. The price level date for this Cost Book is assumed to be Jan 2024. A 2.99% adjustment factor was included in the MCACES estimate to normalize the costs to 2nd Quarter 2025. Quotes were received for major material cost items and were overridden within the MCACES estimate.

## <span id="page-7-8"></span>**4.4 Escalation.**

Escalation has been calculated within the estimate. Once labor, equipment, and material prices were normalized an escalation factor was included at the owner level to escalate the overall estimate to a price level date of the midpoint of construction. The estimate is dated FY25Q2 and is considered the first costs. The price level date of the MCACES estimate is Oct 2033. Price levels within the Total Project Cost Summary

have been escalated from price levels of the construction cost estimate to the midpoint of construction.

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**4.5 Functional Costs.**

Functional costs identifying the work were developed from quantity take-offs using hand sketches and excel spreadsheets, historical costs and input from PDT members as follows:

- **01 Lands and Damages:** This account covers Real Estate costs for Construction. The estimate includes a range of 3% of the construction costs for the low end and 8% of the construction costs for the high end.
- **02 Relocations:** This account covers the relocations of utilities and roads/Bridges. For utilities the estimate includes a range of 1% of the construction costs for the low end and 5% of the construction costs for the high end. For roads and M2 estimate was develop a low and a high end of costs. For bridge costs cost analysis was performed to arrive at current pricing for new bridges and demo of existing bridges
- **11 Levees & Floodwalls:** This account covers Levees (raises/new), seepage berms, drainage structures, riprap, seeding, and ring levees. The range of prices for these items were derived using the Levee Safety tool.
- **30 Planning, Engineering and Design (PED):** This account covers all costs associated with Planning, Engineering, and Design. The costs are based on 30 percent of the construction cost. This percentage was suggested to the Project Manager by EDC-C based on the MCX recommendation.
- **31 Construction Management (CM):** This account covers supervision and administration costs during construction. The costs are based on 15 percent of the construction cost. This percentage was suggested to the Project Manager by EDC-C based on the MCX recommendation and accepted for use in the TPCS.

# <span id="page-8-1"></span>**4.6 Contingencies by Feature**.

The Levee Cost Estimating Tool 02-25-2025 was used to determine the contingency factor to utilize. The Levee Cost Estimating Tool suggests a 35% factor to use for the low end and a 55% factor to use on the high end.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**4.7 Total Project Cost Summary**.

The Total Project Costs includes the construction costs from the estimate backup support, project markups, as well as costs for Real Estate, Utilities, Environmental, Planning, Engineering & Design, Construction Management, and Contingency. The following table (D4) shows the project first cost and fully funded cost of each alternative. Nonstructural costs were completed by the economics team members.
